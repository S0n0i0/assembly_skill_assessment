# assembly_skill_assessment
 Master's degree thesis at the University of Trento. This project is about creating a system based on the assessment of a worker's skills in the manufacturing environment. In this way, an industry 5.0 environment can be implemented and thus create a human-centric situation within the company, going to put the well-being of the worker at the center of the production process.
